 * Builder for {@link Post} objects.

 * A {@link Post} consists of the following elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>an ID,</li>
 * <li>a {@link Sone sender},</li>
 * <li>an optional {@link Sone recipient},</li>
 * <li>a time,</li>
 * <li>and a text.</li>

 * (which should be used for new posts) or a custom ID you specify (for creating
 * an existing post). For the time you can use the current time (again, for
 * creating new posts) or the given time (for loading posts). It is an error to
 * specify both ways for either the ID or the time.
